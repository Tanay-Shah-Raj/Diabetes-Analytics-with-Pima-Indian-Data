# Diabetes Data Analysis and Prediction

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and builds a classification model on the Pima Indians diabetes dataset. It aims to uncover diabetes patterns and predict diabetes outcomes, focusing on a community known to have a predisposition to the condition.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (kg/(mÂ²))
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: Likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- **Age**: Age in years
- **Outcome**: Diabetes class variable (0: non-diabetic, 1: diabetic)

## Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Import the dataset
   - Handle missing values and outliers

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize variable distributions and relationships
   - Identify trends and correlations

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Standardize/normalize numerical features
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets

4. **Model Training**
   - Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
   - Evaluate with metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall

5. **Interpretation & Recommendations**
   - Analyze key features influencing predictions
   - Provide actionable insights for diabetes prediction

## Objective

To gain insights into diabetes patterns among the Pima Indians tribe and build a robust predictive model for informed decision-making.

Happy Analyzing!
