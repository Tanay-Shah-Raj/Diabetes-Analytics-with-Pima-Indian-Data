Project Description: Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Training on Diabetes Data

Objective:
In this project, we aim to analyze diabetes data from the Pima Indians tribe and address important business problems/questions through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model Training using Python.

Problem Statement:
Diabetes is a prevalent global health concern, with both genetic and lifestyle factors contributing to its occurrence. Our focus is on exploring and understanding diabetes patterns within the Pima Indians tribe, a community known for its susceptibility to diabetes, especially among females.

Research Context:
Several years ago, a study was conducted on the Pima tribe in America, revealing early-onset diabetes in females. Our project seeks to delve into various aspects of diabetes within the Pima Indians tribe, leveraging Exploratory Data Analysis techniques and building a classification model to better understand and predict diabetes occurrences.

Dataset Information:
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration 2 hours after an oral glucose tolerance test
Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) test
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function scoring the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age: Age in years
Outcome: Class variable (0: person is not diabetic, 1: person is diabetic)

Project Workflow:

Data Loading and Cleaning:
Load the diabetes dataset.
Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explore the distribution of each variable.
Analyze relationships between variables.
Visualize patterns and trends in the data.
Identify potential correlations and insights.

Data Preprocessing:
Standardize or normalize numerical features.
Encode categorical features if present.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Training:
Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict diabetes outcomes.
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

Interpretation and Recommendations:
Interpret model results and identify key features influencing diabetes predictions.
Provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

Note:
This project provides a hands-on experience in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning modeling.
Emphasis is placed on understanding diabetes patterns and building a predictive model for informed decision-making.
Happy Analyzing!
